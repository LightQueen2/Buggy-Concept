# Buggy-Concept
Buggy-Design / Assembly / Frame-Chassis / Suspension


Modeling Methodology

The model was developed using a structured CAD workflow:

3.1 Frame Construction

Skeleton-based design approach

3D sketches used to define tube centerlines

Weldments environment for structural members

Standard structural profiles applied

3.2 Assembly Strategy

Top-down modeling philosophy

Reference planes and master sketches used for alignment

Mates and constraints applied to simulate realistic articulation

3.3 Parametric Control

Key dimensions controlled via global variables

Scalable wheelbase and track width

Adjustable roll cage geometry

4. Structural Design Considerations

Triangulated bracing implemented for torsional stiffness

Reinforced mounting points for:

Suspension arms

Engine supports

Steering column

Roll-over protection integrated into main frame

Symmetry maintained where possible to simplify manufacturing
